# Redditor
Redditor that does the hard work of *cough cough* going to [Reddit](http://reddit.com) and looking for just about anything you’d need. There’s probably more than enough commands so that you will never need to type reddit.com into your address bar ever again. It can browse subreddits. It can look up Redditors. It can do basically anything that Reddit has to offer.

That’s all to it for now. If you’d like to suggest any features, feel free to join our Support Server and you’ll be able to suggest there.
